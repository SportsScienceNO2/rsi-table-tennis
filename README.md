## 📂 1. Repository Structure

To ensure full reproducibility, the repository is organized as follows:

| Folder | Content Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`data/`** | Contains the primary anonymized dataset (`Data_TableTennis.csv`). |
| **`notebooks/`** | Jupyter Notebooks with the complete analytical workflow (`MAIN_ANALYSIS.ipynb`). |
| **`figures/`** | High-resolution (600 DPI) publication-ready plots generated by the code. |

## 📊 2. Data & Visualizations

### Dataset
The original anonymized data from field tests uses a semicolon (`;`) separator. It serves as the direct input for all statistical models.

### Generated Figures
The following figures are automatically exported to the `figures/` folder in TIFF format (LZW compression):

* **Figure 1: Individual Data Distribution** – Showcases the dispersion and functional heterogeneity of both groups for Velocity and Efficiency.
* **Figure 2: Regression Plots** – Visualizes the predictive relationship between neuromuscular qualities (Sprint/RSI) and technical outcomes.

## 💻 3. Reproducibility Pipeline

The analytical workflow in `MAIN_ANALYSIS.ipynb` is self-contained and follows these steps:

1. **Standardized Preprocessing:** Numeric cleaning, decimal comma handling, and automated header standardization.
2. **Reliability Analysis:** Calculation of **ICC (3,1)** (Two-way mixed, consistency) and **CV%** derived from Typical Error of Measurement (%TEM).
3. **Group Comparisons:** Independent T-tests with **Welch’s correction** for unequal variances and **Hedges’ g** effect sizes for small sample bias.
4. **RSI Optimization (ANOVA):** **Repeated Measures ANOVA** across 15cm, 30cm, and 45cm drop heights to identify optimal mechanical loads.
5. **Predictive Modeling:** **Spearman Correlations** and **Simple Linear Regression (OLS)** to determine performance predictors.

## 📈 4. Key Findings Summary

### **RSI Optimization (ANOVA)**
- **Insight:** 30cm was identified as the descriptive peak of performance for both groups.
- **Stats:** Conventional ($F=1.36, p=0.269$); Para-athlete ($F=1.71, p=0.206$). Despite the lack of omnibus significance, 30cm was selected for regression models as the representative optimal mechanical load.

### **Predictive Modeling (Regression)**
- **Conventional Group:** 10m Sprint significantly predicts **36%** of Peak Ball Velocity ($R^2=0.36, p=0.007$).
- **Para-athlete Group:** RSI at 30cm explains **26%** of Technical Efficiency ($R^2=0.26, p=0.106$), showing a moderate trend despite the small sample size ($n=11$).
